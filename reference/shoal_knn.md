# k-Nearest Neighbours

Finds the `k` nearest neighbours of every row of `x` among the other
rows, or of every row of `query` among the rows of `x`, by an exact
search in Rust. Every metric of
[`shoal_dist()`](https://belian-earth.github.io/shoal/reference/shoal_dist.md)
is available and the distances agree with it exactly, but only the `k`
nearest are kept, so the memory is proportional to `k` times the number
of rows rather than to the square of it. Where a distance matrix stops
being possible somewhere in the tens of thousands of rows, a neighbour
search does not.

## Usage

``` r
shoal_knn(
  x,
  k,
  query = NULL,
  metric = c("euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary", "minkowski",
    "cosine", "correlation", "mahalanobis"),
  p = 2,
  cov = NULL,
  search = c("auto", "kdtree", "brute")
)

# S3 method for class 'shoal_knn'
print(x, ...)

# S3 method for class 'shoal_knn'
plot(x, which = x$k, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A numeric matrix or data frame of the points to search among. Data
  frames are coerced to a matrix using their numeric columns
  (non-numeric columns are dropped). Rows containing missing or
  non-finite values are an error.

- k:

  Number of neighbours to find. Must be less than `nrow(x)` when `query`
  is `NULL`, and at most `nrow(x)` otherwise.

- query:

  Optional numeric matrix or data frame of points to find neighbours
  for, with the same columns as `x`. `NULL` (default) searches the rows
  of `x` against one another.

- metric:

  Distance metric. One of `"euclidean"`, `"maximum"`, `"manhattan"`,
  `"canberra"`, `"binary"`, `"minkowski"`, `"cosine"`, `"correlation"`
  or `"mahalanobis"`.

- p:

  Power for `metric = "minkowski"`. Ignored otherwise. Default `2`.

- cov:

  Covariance matrix for `metric = "mahalanobis"`, `ncol(x)` square and
  positive definite. `NULL` (default) uses
  [`stats::cov()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/cor.html) of `x`, the
  reference set, whichever of `x` and `query` is being measured. Ignored
  for other metrics.

- search:

  Search algorithm: `"auto"` (default), `"kdtree"` or `"brute"`. See
  Details. `"kdtree"` is an error for a metric the tree cannot bound.

- ...:

  For [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html), further
  arguments to
  [`plot.default()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html);
  `main`, `xlab` and `ylab` given here replace the defaults. Ignored by
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html).

- which:

  Which neighbour's distance to plot, between `1` and `x$k`. Default
  `x$k`.

## Value

An object of class `"shoal_knn"`: a list with components `id`, an
integer matrix of row indices into `x`, and `dist`, a numeric matrix of
the corresponding distances. Both have one row per point searched for
and `k` columns, nearest first, with the row names of `x` or `query` and
column names `1` to `k`. `k`, `metric` and `search` record the call,
`search` being the algorithm actually used.

## Details

Two exact searches are available and give identical results, tie order
included. `"brute"` compares every query row with every data row, in
parallel over queries; it serves every metric. `"kdtree"` builds an
axis-aligned kd-tree and skips regions that cannot hold a nearer point;
it serves every metric but `"canberra"` and `"binary"`, whose distances
no rectangle can bound. `"cosine"` and `"correlation"` are searched
through a unit-normalised (and, for correlation, centred) copy of the
rows, on which Euclidean distance orders points exactly as the metric
does; the distances reported are still the metric itself. A tree prunes
well in a few dimensions and hardly at all beyond about ten, where the
scan is several times faster than the kd-tree searches in the dbscan and
FNN packages even on one thread. The default `"auto"` takes the tree
when the metric allows it and `ncol(x)` is at most 8, and the scan
otherwise. The tree is built in parallel, so on a large low-dimensional
set the build is a small part of the total. The tree path holds one
extra copy of `x`, its rows reordered so that each leaf is contiguous in
memory.

The conventions follow
[`dbscan::kNN()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/dbscan/man/kNN.html), so code
written for its results works on these. Without `query`, each row is
excluded from its own neighbours. With `query`, every row of `x` is a
candidate, so a query identical to a data row finds that row at distance
zero. Neighbours are sorted by distance, and equal distances by row
index, so the result is fully determined by the input. Rows with missing
or non-finite values are an error rather than being dropped as
[`shoal_dist()`](https://belian-earth.github.io/shoal/reference/shoal_dist.md)
does: dropping rows would renumber the indices so they no longer point
into the caller's matrix.

The [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) method
draws each point's distance to its `k`-th neighbour in increasing order.
The knee of that curve is the usual choice of `eps` for
[`shoal_dbscan()`](https://belian-earth.github.io/shoal/reference/shoal_dbscan.md)
with `min_samples = k + 1`; the point itself counts towards
`min_samples`, hence the one.
